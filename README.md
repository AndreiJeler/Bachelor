# Bachelor Thesis - Correctness of Fitness Movements using Machine Learning
  Application developed for the Batchelor Thesis, where Machine Learning is used to detect possible mistakes in the fitness movements executed by the user in front of a webcam, Kinect, or from a video given as input. Additionally, it detects in which state the movement is, to be able to count the number of repetitions executed. <br /> <br />
  The server is made in Python using Flask and MongoDB to store the information about users, exercises, and the place on the disk where the models are stored. It sends the necessary information to the client, together with the Tensorflow model of an exercise, such that the predictions are made on the client-side, because it implies video processing, and there would be a lot of requests to the server. <br /> <br />
  The client is a combination of a Python application and a .NET application. The main application is written in Python and is used by the user to navigate through the whole application, letting the user to login, register, see the history of the executed exercises in the past, the selection of the exercises from a list. Python is also used to run the application with the webcam or feed a video to OpenCV, which, together with Media Pipe, is responsible for predicting the correctness. .NET is mostly used to let the application take advantage of the Kinect 360 sensor for the detections that are, in some cases, more precise.
